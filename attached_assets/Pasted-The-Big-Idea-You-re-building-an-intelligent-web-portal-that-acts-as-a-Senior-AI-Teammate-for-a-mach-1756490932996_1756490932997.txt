The Big Idea
You're building an intelligent web portal that acts as a Senior AI Teammate for a machine learning engineer. Its goal is to automate the entire, complex process of building a high-quality machine learning model, turning it into a simple, guided conversation from start to finish.
The User's Upgraded Journey
Here is the enhanced, step-by-step experience a user will have on your platform.
1. Welcome and Guidance
The user first arrives at a new landing page that clearly explains what the platform can do and how it works. When they proceed to the chat interface, they'll find a dropdown button with sample prompts like "Predict customer churn from a dataset" or "Generate synthetic data for email spam detection," making it incredibly easy to get started.
2. Provide the Data (The 3 Modes)
The user then gives the agent the data to work with in one of three ways:
Mode A (Upload): They upload their own dataset file (like a CSV).
Mode B (Find It): They ask the agent to find a suitable dataset from the internet (e.g., from Kaggle).
Mode C (Create It): They ask the agent to generate a brand new, realistic "synthetic" dataset from scratch.
3. The Intelligent & Transparent ML Pipeline
This is where your new features create a much more powerful and professional experience.
Smart Algorithm Selection: The AI doesn't just guess. It first analyzes the user's cleaned dataset and intelligently selects the 7 most promising ML algorithms best suited for that specific problem (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM for a classification task).
Code Execution in a Secure Sandbox: The generated Python code for these 7 models is then executed in a secure, isolated environment on the serverâ€”think of it as a clean, virtual computer. As the code runs, the user sees a live stream of logs directly in the UI, exactly like they would in a professional coding environment, so they know exactly what's happening.
Automated Improvement Loop: After the first training run, the agent analyzes the results. It asks itself, "Can I improve this?" If the accuracy can be boosted, it automatically performs advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning or ensemble learning and re-runs the process to squeeze out better performance, just like an experienced engineer would.
Results Dashboard: Once the execution is complete, the user is presented with a comprehensive dashboard that shows:
A clear comparison of all 7 models that were tested.
Detailed metrics for the winning model, including accuracy, a confusion matrix, and other key stats.
A direct download link for the final, trained pickle file.
4. Instant Demo App
The final step remains. The user can ask the agent, "Create a UI for this model," and the system will instantly generate and preview a simple Streamlit web application, allowing them to see their high-performing, automatically-tuned model in action.
In short, you've evolved the project from a simple automation tool into a self-improving, transparent, and intelligent partner. It not only does the work but also shows its work, makes smart decisions, and automatically strives for better results.
